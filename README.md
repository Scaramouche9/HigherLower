# Title: Higher-Lower, a Number Game

# Project Description:

Higher Lower is a number guessing game that allows players to track their guesses to beat previous scores.

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this project. I experimented with using an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to run my code automatically. I also made use of some new methods I discovered-- include(), to check if the guessed number was already in the array of guesses, and join(), to add spaces between the array items for a cleaner look.

I'd be interested in improving this game further:

1. Further simplifying the code and moving functions to a new document
2. Clearing the input form between guesses
3. Allowing users to sumbit guesses by pressing the "Enter" key
4. Adding more styling to my CSS rules

# How to Play

1. You will be prompted to enter a number upon the page loading. Enter any positive number.
2. Guess any number between 1 and the number you chose.
3. You will receive feedback after that guess if the number is too high or too low. Follow the clues to guess the correct number.
4. Guess the correct number to see how many guesses you took and what your guesses were-- see if you can improve your score!
